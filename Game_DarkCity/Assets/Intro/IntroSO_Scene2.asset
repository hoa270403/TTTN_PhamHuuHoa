  introText: 'It would just be a myth until one day, the fake adventurers returned
    and confirmed that Bermudos is real. They had been there and back. They wanted
    to call on other adventurers to join them in exploring Bermudos Island. They
    claimed that in Bermudos, when you die, you will be resurrected. This attracted
    many adventurers to sign up. '
